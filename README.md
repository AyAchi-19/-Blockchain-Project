This project is a hands-on exploration of blockchain technology, where I built a functional blockchain from scratch. Here’s what it does:
✅ Mine Blocks: Perform useful work (matrix multiplication) to add new blocks to the chain.
✅ Add Transactions: Securely record transactions between users.
✅ Validate the Chain: Ensure the integrity of the blockchain.
✅ Interactive Web Interface: Built with Flask, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.
✅ MySQL Integration: Store transactions in a database for persistence and easy retrieval.
